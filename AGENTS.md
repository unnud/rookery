# AGENTS.md (Repo Instructions)

This repository is a continuously updated knowledge base about Rails + Ruby + vibe coding in the Korean context.

## North Star

- Prefer *accurate, citeable summaries* over long prose.
- Keep updates *date-stamped*.
- Separate *facts* from *opinions/inferences*.

## Content Types

- Case study: `docs/case-studies/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- Video note: `docs/videos/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- Prompt recipe: `docs/prompts/<slug>.md`

## Required Metadata (per doc)

At the top of every doc, include:

- Title
- Date (when the doc was written/updated)
- Tags
- Sources (URLs)

## Style Rules

- No large verbatim quotes. Summarize, then link to sources.
- If you mention a number, claim, or timeline: include a source link.
- If uncertain: label as `Assumption` or `Hypothesis`.
- Use short sections:
  - `Context` (what/why)
  - `Key Takeaways` (3-7 bullets)
  - `Notes` (optional)
  - `Sources`

## Update Checklist

- Add/update doc in `docs/...`
- Ensure it is linked from `docs/index.md` (or an appropriate hub page)
- Keep filenames stable; avoid renames unless necessary
